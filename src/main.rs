/*
 * pointer -> general concept for variable that stores a memory-address pointing to other data in memory
 * Most common pointer is a reference (&) -> don't own data
 * smart pointers -> data structures that have additional metadata and extra capabilities, own data
 *                   structs with deref(allows instances to be treated like references) and
 *                   drop(allows customizing behaviour when out of scope) trait
 * reference counting smart pointer -> allows for multiple owners by tracking them, cleans after no owners
 * String and vector -> also smart pointers
